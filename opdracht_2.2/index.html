        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. <br>
            It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of <br>
            the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>

        <h2>What are HTML-Elements?</h2>
        <p>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the <br> data supplied to be
            displayed.</p>

        <h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?</h2>
        <p>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand <br> how the developer intended
            the data to appear on the screen.</p>

        <h2>More Elements</h2>
            <h3>A-tag</h3>
            <p>The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other
            areas within our own web page). <br> You will always see the ‘a’ element used with
            the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.</p>

        <h3>Img-tag</h3>
            <p>This element will display an image on the screen. <br> It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which 
            points to the address of the image to be displayed. <br> NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in 
            they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:</p>
